A simple cubing utility used to view what the rank of any time in any WCA event would be officially. It makes use of [louismeunier/wca-stats-helper](https://github.com/louismeunier/wca-stats-helper) to obtain full WCA rankings for each event. It also uses [cubing/icons](https://github.com/cubing/icons) for the cubing icons.

Built using Svelte.
